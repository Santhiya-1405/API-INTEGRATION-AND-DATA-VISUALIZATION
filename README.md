This project is a Python console-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical experience in API integration, data processing, and data visualization using Python. Users can enter a city name, and the program retrieves current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness, and weather description. This allows users to get a quick understanding of the current weather conditions in any city worldwide.The application uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. The API responds with data in JSON format, which the program parses to extract the required weather parameters. The program includes error handling to manage invalid city names gracefully. If a user enters a city that does not exist, the program informs them and asks for a valid input instead of crashing. This feature improves user experience and demonstrates the importance of exception handling in real-world programming.
Once the data is retrieved, the weather information is displayed in a well-formatted console output. The output also includes the current date and time using Python’s datetime module, providing a clear and professional presentation. Users can easily read and understand the information because of the structured layout. In addition to textual output, the program provides visual representation of key weather parameters using the Matplotlib library. A bar chart is generated to show temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness. This visualization helps users interpret the data quickly and adds an interactive aspect to the console application. The bar chart includes proper labels, titles, and grid lines to ensure clarity.The project was developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and version-controlled with Git and GitHub, demonstrating practical Python programming, API integration, and data visualization skills. This beginner-friendly application can be extended with features like multi-day forecasts or GUI interfaces in the future
