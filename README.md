This is a Python console-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name, and the program retrieves current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness, and weather description.
The application uses the requests library to interact with the API and parses the JSON response to extract relevant information. It also includes error handling to manage invalid city names gracefully. Weather details are displayed in a formatted console output, along with the current date and time using the datetime module, providing a professional and clear presentation.
For better understanding, the program visualizes key parameters using Matplotlib to generate a bar chart representing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness. This helps users quickly interpret the weather data.The project was developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and version-controlled with Git and GitHub, demonstrating practical Python programming, API integration, and data visualization skills. This beginner-friendly application can be extended with features like multi-day forecasts or GUI interfaces in the future.
